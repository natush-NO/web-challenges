# Watchlist Page

## Value Proposition

**As a** `user` <br>
**I want to** `view and manage my list of saved movies` <br>
**so that** `I can keep track of the movies I want to watch and easily access them later` <br>

## Description

The Watchlist Page is designed to display the movies that a user has saved. If the watchlist is empty, a message will prompt the user to add movies by clicking 'Add to Watchlist' on the movie details page.
